# 🔬 Multiple Disease Prediction System (ML + Flask Web App)

## 🧠 Overview
This is an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to predict whether a person may be affected by specific medical conditions based on health-related input data.

The system currently supports prediction for:
- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Parkinson’s Disease

Built with Python and deployed using Flask, this web app aims to demonstrate real-time health condition prediction using trained ML models.
